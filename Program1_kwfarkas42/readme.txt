Project Title
CSC 1300-001 Programming Assignment 1: Basic Arithmetic Operations


Description
The program will ask the user to perform basic arithmetic operations. The program will auto-generate two
random variables (range: 0 to 99), e.g., firstRandValue and secondRandValue. Based on the user choice of
arithmetic operation, such as addition, subtraction, and multiplication, the user will be asked to 
compute the result. Furthermore, the user will be asked two additional questions: (1) is the result a
positive number, a negative number, or zero? and (2) Is the result an even number (including zero) or
an odd number?


Prerequisites
- GCC Library
