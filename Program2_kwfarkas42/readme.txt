Project Title
CSC 1300-001 Programming Assignment 2: Standard Math Program


Description
The program will ask the user to input a positive integer, and then it will perform a set of mathematical
tasks. Given the positive integer input (e.g., n), the program will (1)compute the sum of 1 to n, (2)compute
the factorial value of n, (3)display the times table of n in a certain way, (4)check whether n is even or odd,
(5)check whether or not n is a prime number, and (6)check whether or not n is an Armstrong number.


Prerequisites 
- GCC Library


Execution
A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Step 1. Unzip the folder and then go to the folder
Step 2. Run your terminal from the folder
Step 3. Compile the code using the following command:
g++ -o main main.cpp utils.cpp 
Step 4. Execute the code using the following command:
Mac - ./main             Windows - main
Step 5. After successful execution and evaluating the program, please remove the executable file using the
following command:
Mac - rm main            Windows - del/f/q/a main.exe
